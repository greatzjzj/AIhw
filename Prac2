3.  In the goal setting, we determine what we are interested in and what can be ignored. 
    Then in the problem formula we decide how to manipulate important aspects while ignoring other aspects. 
    If we first develop the problem, we will not know what to include and what to miss. 
    That is to say, there may be a set of iterations between problem formulation and problem solving until a sufficiently useful and effective solution is reached.

    2.A:[B], B:[C, D], C:[E, G, D], E:[F, D], F:[D], D:[H, G], H:[I, K ,G], I=GOAL
5.  a.                            1\

    b. BFS: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
       DFS: 1 2 4 8 9 5 10 11
       IDS: 1; 1 2 3; 1 2 4 5 3 6 7 ; 1 2 4 8 9 5 10 11
    c. It is useful. The only successor of n in the reverse direction is n/2 which helps focus the search. The branching factor is 2 in the forward direction; 1 in the reverse direction
    d. Yes.getting from 1 and apply the single reverse successor action until you reach 1.
    e. Read off the binary numeral for thee goal number. We can only reach positive integers, this binary expansion begins with a 1. From most to least significant bit, skipping the initial 1, go left to the node 2n if this bit is 0 and go right to node 2n+1 if it is 1
